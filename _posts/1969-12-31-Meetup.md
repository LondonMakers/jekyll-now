Setup of Kodi on a Raspberry Pi . (https://www.meetup.com/Londons-Studio-Photography-Group/events/237783454/?rv=co1&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDRkNDBlZDhiLWI0ZWMtNDQ2Zi1iMzQ2LWNiM2MyM2RlZmE1Yg)

Dan has volunteered to take us through setting up Raspberry Pi with Kodi as a streaming media server.

We will take a fresh Raspberry Pi and load the o/s and Kodi and then set up and configure.

Steps

1-format SD card
2-write image to SD
3-boot and do first setup of LibreElec ( set time, LAN etc.)
4-get and install Fusion repo
5-install Exodus plugin and/or any other plugins you want

What you will need.

• Raspberry Pi 2 or 3

• SD card, preferably class 10 4GB or better.

• HDMI capable monitor and cable, keyboard and mouse if you can, we will have a couple on site but will have to share so bring them if you have them.

• We will have a couple machines loaded with the software for formatting but if you want to do your own bring a laptop as well.

We will have to limit the numbers on this one to 8 due to space and time so sign up early.
