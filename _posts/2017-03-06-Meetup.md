Sorry have to postpone for 2 weeks till the 17th - CNC router not working waiting for parts and the lathe is also waiting for parts so we could only demo 3 machines. Its better to wait.

****important******

with so many people coming to this meetup everyone needs to bring their own safety glasses.

****************

So lets get together and talk about CNC machines.

We will have a demos set up for a

• CNC plasma cutter

• CNC Mill

• CNC lathe

• CNC Router

• CNC Laser Cutter/engraver

We can discuss the various programs for designing parts and methods for creating the tool paths in each type of machine.

Software like

• Fusion360

• Vetric Aspire

• Corel Draw

Look forward to seeing you there.
