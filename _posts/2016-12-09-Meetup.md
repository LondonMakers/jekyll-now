All About Mini-sumo Robots

Were going to talk about mini-sumo robots - what they are, where you can get them, and how you can build them. Well also be demoing a couple of custom-designed and built mini-sumos as they battle.

we will start with 30-45 minutes of social time then Jon will do his talk and demo.
