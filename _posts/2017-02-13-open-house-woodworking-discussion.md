Open House - Woodworking Discussion


I'm back in town and thought we should have a meeting.  This will be an open meeting with time for social and we can see some of the woodworking going on.

I will explain the construction techniques I am using for the benches and drawers and go over some of the woodworking tools in general. 

Anyone else with something of a show and tell can let me know and I will carve out some time for you as well.  Hope to see some of you out.
