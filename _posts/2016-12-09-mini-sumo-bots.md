All About Mini-Sumo Robots

![Mini Sumo!](/images/minisumo.jpg)

Were going to talk about mini-sumo robots - What they are, where you can get them, and how you can build them. We'll also be demoing a couple of custom-designed and built mini-sumos as they battle.


We will start with 30-45 minutes of social time then Jon will do his talk and demo.


[Come check it out @ the MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/londonmakerscommunity/events/236137358/)


Contact us in the live chat above or social links below, if you have a skills or builds you would like to demo.
