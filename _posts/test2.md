Were going to talk about mini-sumo robots - what they are, where you can get them, and how you can build them. Well also be demoing a couple of custom-designed and built mini-sumos as they battle.

we will start with 30-45 minutes of social time then Jon will do his talk and demo.\r\n \r\nhttps://www.meetup.com/londonmakerscommunity/events/236137358/\r\n \r\nContact us if you have a skill you would like to demo.\r\n \r\n\r\n![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-logo.png)\r\n
