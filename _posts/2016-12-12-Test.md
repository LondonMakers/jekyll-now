All About Mini-sumo Robots

Were going to talk about mini-sumo robots - What they are, where you can get them, and how you can build them. We will also be demoing a couple of custom-designed and built mini-sumos as they battle.

We will start with 30-45 minutes of social time then Jon will do his talk and demo.

Contact us if you have a skill you would like to demo.
