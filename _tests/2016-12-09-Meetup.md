All About Mini-sumo Robots

We're going to talk about mini-sumo robots - what they are, where you can get them, and how you can build them. We'll also be demoing a couple of custom-designed and built mini-sumos as they battle.

we will start with 30-45 minutes of social time then Jon will do his talk and demo.
 
[Come check it out @ the MeetUp!](https://www.meetup.com/londonmakerscommunity/events/236137358/)
 
Contact us on the Live Chat above or Social feeds below if you have a skills or project builds you would like to demo at any of the meetups.
