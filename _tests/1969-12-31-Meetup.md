Setup of KODI on a Raspberry Pi

Dan has volunteered to take us through setting up Raspberry Pi with KODI as a streaming media server.

We will take a fresh Raspberry Pi and load the OS and KODI and then set up and configure.

Steps

1.) Format SD card

2.) Write image to SD

3.) Boot and do the first setup of LibreElec ( set time, LAN etc.)

4.) Get and install Fusion repo

5.) Install Exodus plugin and/or any other plugins you want

What You Will Need

• Raspberry Pi 2 or 3

• SD card, preferably class 10 4GB or better.

• HDMI capable monitor and cable, keyboard and mouse if you can, we will have a couple on site but will have to share so bring them if you have them.

• We will have a couple machines loaded with the software for formatting but if you want to do your own bring a laptop as well.

We will have to limit the numbers on this one to 8 due to space and time so sign up early.
